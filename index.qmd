BioMedical Data Science is the perfect combination of three of my passions: statistics, biology, and programming. During my career, I have used computational algorithms and statistical models to answer biological questions.

My academic research over six years at the [GOLD lab](https://www.gold-lab.org/){target="_blank"} (Master, PhD, and Postdoc) focused on cancer genomics, specifically in detecting long non-coding RNAs (genes that do not encode proteins) mutated in cancer patients. I acquired knowledge in cancer biology, molecular genetics, in statistical modeling, data analysis, and programming (Python, Perl, R, and Unix). My work during this period resulted in 8 publications, with four of them where I was first author ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=h1VE1i8AAAAJ&hl=en){target="_blank"}).

I transitioned to the private sector as Data Scientist at [Biognosys](https://www.biognosys.com){target="_blank"}, where I was introduced to proteomics. During this phase, I applied my technical expertise to the generation and mining of big proteomic data, batch effect correction, and visualization of results for scientific and business stakeholders. One example of my projects at Biognosys is the [3D Protein Explorer](https://biognosys.shinyapps.io/3D_protein_explorer/){target="_blank"}.

As a Data Scientist at [Idorsia](https://www.idorsia.com/){target="_blank"}, I focused on target and biomarker discovery by making use of multi-omics, clinical data and Real World Data (RWD), for the oncology and immunology therapeutic areas.

Now, as Co-Founder and CSO of [TrueYouOmics](https://www.trueyouomics.com/){target="_blank"}, my objective is to develop the most comprehensive blood test for disease risk identification and prevention planning via multi-omics and artificial intelligence. TrueYouOmics is part of the [Start-up Booster Grant at CSEM](https://www.csem.ch/en/start-up-booster-grant/){target="_blank"}.

Other interests of mine are investments, trading, economy, technology, entrepreneurship, sustainability, volunteering, survival, bouldering, and fitness.

I am always interested in projects related to the topics described above, and I am open to insightful conversations. Feel free to contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreslanzos/){target="_blank"} for opportunities and networking.
