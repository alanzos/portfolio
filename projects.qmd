## Why I stopped using Precision and Accuracy for binary classification

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
Precision and Accuracy are the most common performance metrics when dealing with binary classification problems. Doing some research, I found out that they are not robust enough for frequent scenarios in biomedical data science. Find out why, and what is the alternative metric on my [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-stopped-using-precision-accuracy-binary-andr%C3%A9s-lanz%C3%B3s/){target="_blank"}. All the code is available at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alanzos/performance_metrics_for_binary_classification){target="_blank"}.

Diversification is essential in an investment portfolio. That is why I developed a [Shiny app](https://andreslanzos.shinyapps.io/microwd_diversification/){target="_blank"} to explore the diversification of my investments in [Microwd](https://www.microwd.es/en/){target="_blank"}. All the code is available at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alanzos/microwd_diversification){target="_blank"}.

## Shihy app to trace your blood/urine test

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
Every time I have done a blood or urine test, it was difficult to compare to previous values. That is why I collected my results from the last +5 years and created [VitaTracer](https://andreslanzos.shinyapps.io/VitaTracer){target="_blank"}. This Shiny app allows me to see a summary of all my values, and inspect how they evolved over time. All the code is available at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alanzos/VitaTracer){target="_blank"}.
