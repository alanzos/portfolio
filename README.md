# Portfolio developed with Quarto

Having a portfolio is a good way to show your work as a data scientist. This repository contains the code that I used to create my <a class="reference external" href="https://andreslanzos.quarto.pub/">Portfolio</a>. 

Many thanks to Deepsha Menghani and Posit for the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtSFXtDf4cM">Create your Data Science Portfolio with Quarto</a> meetup event, where I learned how to develop and publish this portfolio.
